        <h3>A self-hosted, bare metal HPC and Kubernetes cluster</h3>
    </div>

    <div id="main">
        <p>
            CHAD is a self-hosted compute cluster capable of running HPC workloads and Kubernetes.
            This project originally grew from the single dedicated web server I hosted in my closet.
        </p>

        <h2 class="header"><b>Motivation</b></h2>
        <p>
            Over 5 years ago, I started using Linux and hosting public-facing services from my desktop; mainly, game servers for me and my friends.
            A couple years later, I repurposed an old desktop as a dedicated machine for my services.
            Having a dedicated machine greatly increased reliability, took load off my desktop, and was very easy to manage.
            This worked out well until the machine started to idle at ~70% memory usage, which meant that adding more services wouldn't be feasible.
            Likewise, all of my services were in danger of going down if the memory spiked and ran out during intensive loads.
        </p>
        <p>
            To fix this, I decided to use some of the machines I had lying around and build them into a horizontally scaling cluster.
            Following this approach would allow for my services to scale while also remaining budget friendly.
        </p>

        <h2 class="header"><b>Design</b></h2>
        <p>
            CHAD is designed to utilize the existing compute resources I had laying around my apartment while also improving on reliability.
            While CHAD is not fully resistant to power outages and internet outages, it can tolerate failures on a couple nodes thanks to kubernetes and load balancing.
        </p>

        <p>
            The cluster's nodes are divided into the following two groups:
        </p>

        <h4 class="header"><b>Infrastructure Nodes</b></h4>
        <p>Low-power and low performance. Supports the main compute nodes with networking and a high-availability k8s control plane.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Salieri - Thinkpad X250</li>
            <ul>
                <li>i5 5300u 2c/4t</li>
                <li>8gb ram</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Kuro - ODROID-C2</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Cortex-A53 4c/4t</li>
                <li>2gb ram</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Miso - Raspberry Pi 3b</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Broadcom BCM2837 4c/4t</li>
                <li>1gb ram</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>^^ Notice how each node could put on a cheap UPS or effectively has one built in.</p>
        <h4 class="header"><b>Compute Nodes</b></h4>
        <p>High-power and fast single/multi core speeds. Runs production services.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Amadeus - Headless Dedicated Machine</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Overclocked i5 3570k 4c/4t</li>
                <li>16gb ram</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Altair - Main Workstation</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Ryzen 3900x 12c/24t</li>
                <li>32gb ram</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Gehenna - Living Room PC</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Overclocked i7 4770k 4c/8t</li>
                <li>16gb ram</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This works out to a total of 20 cores, 36 threads, and 64GB of memory for compute resources, which is a huge improvement from the single dedicated machine.
        </p>

        <h2 class="header"><b>Networking</b></h2>
        <p>
            For security purposes, I won't describe any network configurations.
            However, here is a list of the hardware I use for the cluster:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite</li>
            <li>Juniper Networks EX2200-48P-4G</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Overall, everything runs on wired gigabit connections.
            This works fine and isn't prohibitively expensive compared to 10GbE.
            Latency is <1ms between all nodes.
        </p>

        <h2 class="header"><b>Services</b></h2>
        <p>
            CHAD runs a multitude of Open Source software and game servers, both publicly and privately.
            
        </p>
